This is an introductory blog to our forthcoming series encompassing various domains in Computer Science with primary focus on Artificial Intelligence. In this post we will talk about a popular programming language which is extensively used in the field of Data Science and AI – Python.

The first and the most obvious question that arises or rather must arise is **WHY PYTHON?**

![Comparison Graph](https://github.com/djinit-ai/djinit-ai.github.io/blob/master/_posts/python_comparison.jpg "Comparison Graph")

As of July 2017, Python tops the list of most popular programming language rankings as per IEEE Spectrum. Lets discuss why?
The reason for its rapid emergence and popularity is the diversity and compactness of the language. Python is a general purpose language which has varied applications from building websites to creating predictive models in Machine learning; so once you are proficient with the language you have the freedom to explore different domains which most languages are unable to offer. One can judge its simplicity by its “Hello World” program. Here’s a comparison:

```python
# Python Syntax
print("Hello World")
```

```java
# Java Syntax
public class Main {
  public static void main(Strings[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

So coming back to Python! There is a lot of content on the web and it might get difficult to choose the best course or material to learn from. Here, we have listed down some of the sources that we found useful.

For all those who are completely new to the language (assuming that you know object oriented concepts):
1. link1
2. link2

For all those who have lost touch and wish to revisit the basics:
1.
2.

For all those who are well-versed and wish to flex their Python skills:
1.
2.

Note: The list is in no way comprehensive and only reflects our opinion. Feel free to suggest us more courses/material in the comment section.

We hope this post was helpful. Feel free to comment in case of doubts and do let us know your feedback. Stay tuned for more!
