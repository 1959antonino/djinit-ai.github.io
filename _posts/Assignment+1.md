**ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM SET 1 - Machine Learning 101**



*Assignment 1.1 - Car Classification Problem*

- In this problem, you are provided with a dataset taken from the UCI repository. This repository has an extensive collection of datasets which you can explore to get more practice and use them in your own projects.
- To help you get started with this problem, the startup code has been provided in the Jupyter Notebook linked [here](). Your aim is to try out different classification algorithms and get the best accuracy in classifying the various cars in the dataset.


*Assignment 1.2* - Mushroom Classification Problem

 - Another classification problem for you that you have to solve from scratch. Check out [this]() Kaggle page to know more about the problem statement.
 - The dataset is provided [here](). Your aim  is to classify the mushroom species according to their edibility.

*Assignment 1.3* - Linear Regression Dataset

 - [This]() is a dataset created by us. Use this dataset to implement Linear regression and find the best fit line for the given dataset.
