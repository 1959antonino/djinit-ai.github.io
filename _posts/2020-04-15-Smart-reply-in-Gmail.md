**Getting started with TensorFlow.js**


Machine Learning is a complex discipline but implementing machine program’s or models is far less daunting and difficult that’s due to various machine learning framework such as Google’s Tensorflow, pyTorch, Microsoft’s CNTX ,NEXT . Created By Google Brain team tensorflow is an open source library for ​ Numerical Computation and large scale Machine learning.
In Tensorflow all the computations involves tensors where tensors are the standard way of representing the data in machine learning or deep learning models.Tensor is a vector or matrix of n-Dimensions that represents the data type. All the operations are conducted inside a graph and a graph is a set of computation that take place successively .Each operation is called an open note and are connected to each other . TensorFlow allows the user to create data flow graph which describe how data moves through a graph and a series of processing nodes each node in the graph is represents mathematical operation and each connection is Multidimensional array or tensor.
